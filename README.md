# Branching Dialogue System
This is a Unity engine project that demonstrate how to implement branching dialogue system. The project is about visual novel-like game where player 
can read dialogues, response to the dialogue, and also view which path they end up in the branching story scenario.<br />
I replicate the UI and UX from a game called **Blue Archive** since I love how they execute the design. The codes and implementations I wrote myself.
